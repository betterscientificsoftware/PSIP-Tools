## Target Timeline for Executing the PSIP Process

PSIP is an iterative process where each iteration may take weeks or months to complete.  This document describes a suggested timeline and issues to consider when applying PSIP to a specific project.

We use the START label to indicate the date when creating or revising the Software Practices Document (Step one in the [PSIP workflow diagram](SwPspWorkflow.jpg).  Other times are given relative to this date in number of weeks.

### Timeline 

The following table shows target dates **in weeks** relative to START for each phase.  For example, if the start date is June 28, `-2` in the Date column is June 14. Additional columns list who is involved and provide a brief description of activities.

| Phase       | Date | Participants | Activity |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------ |----------|
| Invitation  | - 4  | Interviewer  | Send an invitation to the software project team.  A [Letter Template](IntroductoryLetterTemplate.md) is available.  Include a link to the [Information Policy](PSIPInformationPolicy.md).
