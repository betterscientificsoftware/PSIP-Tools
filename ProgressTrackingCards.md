# Progress Tracking Cards

An essential aspect of the PSIP process is defining goals and tracking progress.  A Progress Tracking Cards (PTC) is a brief structured document that lists concrete steps toward a specific productivity and sustainability goal. 

### PTC Steps

Each PTC step is given a score.  A score of 0 is the baseline, indicating a team's current approach, regardless of how advanced it is.  Most PTCs will have a top score of 3, 4 or 5, meaning there are 3 to 5 steps on the way to the goal.  The completion of each step should itself provide tangible value to the team beyond making partial progress to the final goal.

### About PTC Scores

PTC values are meant to be ordinal, not cardinal.  In other words, the values are not meant to indicate a global calibration of how well a team conducts a certain practices.  Scores are used within a team to track progress.  They should not be used to assess practices across teams.

### PTC Examples

Statements should be customized and made precise for the team's goals.
