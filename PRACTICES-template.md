# Software Development Practices

This document could potentially go into the repo itself, possibly within the `.github` folder. Its purpose is to document *current* practices of the development team. By having it version controlled the practices can change over time.

The following is loosely in a yaml format: each top-level bullet containins a sub-list of key-value items. This is just a starter list, items and categories should be added or removed to suit each individual project. Reviewing and updating the list can be an excellent on-boarding activity.

Any one of these categories could be a great topic for a PSIP PTC.
