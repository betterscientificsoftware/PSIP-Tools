# Software Development Practices

This document could potentially go into the repo itself, possibly within the `.github` folder. Its purpose is to document *current* practices of the project and development team. By having it under version control, these practices can change over time.

The following is in markdown format: categories are shown as 2nd level headings, details are lists of key-value-style pairs. This is just a starter list, items and categories should be added or removed to suit each individual project. Reviewing and updating the list can be an excellent on-boarding activity. Many of these items would be a great topic for a PSIP PTC.
