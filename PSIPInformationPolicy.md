## The IDEAS-ECP PSIP Information Policy

### Philosophy

The IDEAS-ECP team is focused on assisting ECP software teams improve their software practices for the purpose of improving developer productivity and software sustainability.  A key element of the effort is free dialogue between software teams and IDEAS-ECP.  Without an accurate characterization of team practices, it will be difficult to formulate effective improvement strategies.  At the same time we realize that teams may be reluctant to share information that, out of context, could be interpreted negatively.

### Policy

Because of the potential for sensitive information discussion when having conversations with ECP software teams, IDEAS-ECP is committed to respecting the information shared by software teams. Only releasing information to others with the permission of the software team.
