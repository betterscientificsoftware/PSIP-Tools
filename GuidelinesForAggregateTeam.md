## Working with Aggregate Teams

Advances in computational science sometimes require that independent code teams come together to produce aggregate scientific capabilities such as multi-scale and multi-physics.  Aggregate teams come together with distinct existing cultures, processes, practices and more.  A major challenge this kind of effort faces is determining how to either come to common approaches or handle the diversity.  In this situation, the PSIP interview should focus on answers for the aggregate team more than each individual team.  Bringing the aggregate team together is the _main_ challenge.

### Strategies for Aggregate Teams
1. Catalog processes used by component teams: Knowing the approaches used by component teams is a first step to understand gaps and opportunities to leverage each component team's strengths.
1. Develop a set of policies for how the component teams will interact with each other.
1. Identify and prioritize practices from components teams that could be adopted by other teams to improve overall productivity.
