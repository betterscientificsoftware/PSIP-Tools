Dear xxx,

The IDEAS-ECP Software productivity project is charged with assisting ECP code teams in improving developer productivity and software sustainability for ECP code development. 

 

IDEAS-ECP is hoping to engage [your/our] [project name] project team to identify opportunities for improving practices.  We would like to start the effort by talking with xxx team members to develop a sketch of current software development practices and where practices could improve.

 

I would like to set up an initial interview with IDEAS-ECP to start the process.  Please let me know if you are willing to meet, and who from the team would be good to include in the meeting.

If you have questions or concerns, please let me know.

Thank you.
