## Test Coverage Progress Tracking

Use this issue to track overall progress towards the long-term goal of *better test coverage*.
As progress is made check these items off:

- [ ] Functional testing via users.
      Little or no independent testing.
- [ ] Independent functional testing of primary capabilities.
- [ ] Primary functional testing, some unit test coverage.
- [ ] Comprehensive unit testing, primary functional testing.
- [ ] Functional testing for documented use cases.
- [ ] Test coverage commitment.

### Definitions:

- **Functional testing**:
  Testing capabilities from user's perspective.
  Many functions can be called.
  Good for usability assurance.
  Insufficient to protect against some regressions.
  Difficult to isolate regressions.
  Can require extensive execution times.
- **Unit testing**:
  Isolated, independent testing of functions and methods.
  Enable test-driven development, rapid test execution, and fault isolation.
  Insufficient to ensure functional correctness.
- **Comprehensive**:
  Does not mean 100% line coverage, but sufficient coverage to detect most errors.
  Experts suggest various metrics such as >80% line coverage or a high percentage of function coverage.
- **Commitment**:
  Team is committed to writing comprehensive tests concurrent with functionality.
