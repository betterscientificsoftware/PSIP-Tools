## Unit Testing Progress Tracking

Use this issue to track overall progress towards the long-term goal of *better unit testing*.
As progress is made check these items off:

- [ ] Some unit tests, some developers know how to write them
- [ ] Add lcov/gcov coverage tracking
- [ ] Document process for adding a new unit test
- [ ] Reach 100% developer training on writing unit tests
- [ ] commit to project code coverage policy
