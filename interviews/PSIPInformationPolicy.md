## The IDEAS-ECP PSIP Information Policy

### Philosophy

The PSIP process is intended to help software teams improve their software practices for the purpose of improving developer productivity and software sustainability.  A key element of the process is free dialogue.  Without an accurate characterization of team practices, it will be difficult to formulate effective improvement strategies.  At the same time we realize that teams may be reluctant to share information that, out of context, could be interpreted negatively.

### Policy

The PSIP process includes a commitment to respecting the sensitivity of information shared by software teams. Information gathered as part of the PSIP process will be released to others only with the permission of the software team.
