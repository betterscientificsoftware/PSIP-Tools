Dear xxx,

A key deliverable of the IDEAS-ECP project is to facilitate ECP code teams in identifying
productivity and sustainability improvements and in providing guidance to help teams in
implementing improvements they seek.

IDEAS-ECP is hoping to engage the [**project name**] project team to

- Develop a sketch of current software development practices and
- Discover where the team may be looking for practices to improve.

We would like to set up an initial interview of length 1-2 hours to start the process.
Please let us know if you are willing to meet, and who from the team would be good to
include in the meeting.

If you have questions or concerns, please let us know.

Thank you.
